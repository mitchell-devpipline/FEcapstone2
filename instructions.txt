API URL: https://devpipeline-mock-api.onrender.com

 - Layout: Sidebar with users that are fetched from the given api.
   - users, (formatted first and abbreviated last initial, weight Defaulted to 1, plus and minus weight buttons, which should labeled appropriately)
 - larger middle section that has:
   - label (initial message, intermediate(while selecting) message, selected user)
   - button to initiate selection process
 - loading animation (ex: spinner, shuffle the names, etc)
   - css animation
 - hover effects
 - disabled button while selecting a user

JS
 - fetch users from given api
 - creating dom elements and appending them to the dom
 - each user should be weighted, meaning that they would be more or less likely to be randomly selected
 - users should only be selected 1 time (unless weighted) per round (getting through entire list)
 - once everyone has been selected, the list should start over
 - after starting another round(meaning everyone has been selected), the first person selected cannot be the last person that was selected (no back to back selections unless weighted)
